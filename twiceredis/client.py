class Listener(object):
    """
    TwiceRedis based persistent message handler that can't lose messages

    reliably listen for messages lpushed to a list.
    when a message is received, in one transaction, the message
    will be moved to a processing list. only after the message
    is handled will it be removed from the processing list.

    ## read_time ##
    read_time is the duration we listen for a message before continuing to
    the next iteration of the loop. it is used in conjunction with redis's
    BRPOPLPUSH so Listener can loop slowly when there is little traffic
    while going as quickly as possible when there is much traffic. it also
    prevents timeout exceptions during the listen process. read_time should be
    set to something less than the socket_timeout/tcp keepalive failure time.
    listen will also generate a couple of packets every read_time interval
    even if there are no messages being sent, this keeps the socket alive
    and aids in the detection of a stale socket more quickly.

    if you would rather not mess with read_time, a listen thread, or blocking
    calls of any kind, use Lister.get_message(), it works like listen except it
    just returns None immediately if there are no messages. You'll want your
    handler to return message if you intend on using your own with get_message
    because it will return the result of your handler. By default it'll just
    log and return the message if you'd rather call your handler manually.

    ## old messages ##
    Listener's init will process any old messages laying around in the
    processing list. if you have 2+ listeners listening to the same list, make
    sure message handling is idempotent or use a different processing_suffix
    for each listener. in general you want the processing_suffix to stay the
    same when restarting a worker using Listener objects or messages could
    be lost in the old processing list (ex don't generate new uuid each run)

    ## arguments ##
